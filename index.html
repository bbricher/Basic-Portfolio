        <P>I am originally from Arizona, where I lived until I came to Dallas to go to college. I enjoy playing basketball, painting, and socializing with friends. My most recent life changes have been marriage and a babay. I have a sweet little girl named Anya and a handsome husband named Gabe. I love to joke around with people, in fact, I've joked around enough to have won class clown in high school and in college (which was a small Catholic college that could have superlatives). I currently work with children as a Child Development Coach with a company called PlayWisely. I get the chance to play with little kids between 4 months to 5 years old. I've always had a knack for being around children, since I grew up with 4 younger brithers and 4 older sisters. </P>
        <P>I got a B.S. in Biology at the University of Dallas, and one of the classes that I took was Bioinformatics. In this class was where I discovered I enjoyed coding, because we got to work with the command line to make folders, and we used Python to analyze sequenced DNA and other different type of biology related data. One of my favorite experiences in college was the research internship I had, where I got to extract my own DNA and sequence it myself. </P>
