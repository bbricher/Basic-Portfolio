            <p>I am originally from Arizona, where I lived until I came to Dallas to go to college. I enjoy playing
                basketball, painting, and socializing with friends. My most recent life changes have been marriage and a
                baby. I have a sweet little girl named Anya whose 6 months old and a handsome husband named Gabe whose older than 6 months. I love to joke around
                with people, in fact, I've joked around enough to have won class clown in high school and in college
                (which was a small Catholic college that could have superlatives). I currently work with children as a
                Child Development Coach with a company called PlayWisely. I get the chance to play with little kids
                between 4 months to 5 years old. I've always had a knack for being around children, since I grew up with
                4 younger brithers and 4 older sisters. </p>
            <p>I got a B.S. in Biology at the University of Dallas, and one of the classes that I took was
                Bioinformatics. In this class was where I discovered I enjoyed coding, because we got to work with the
                command line to make folders, and we used Python to analyze sequenced DNA and other different type of
                biology related data. One of my favorite experiences in college was the research internship I had, where
                I got to extract my own DNA and sequence it myself. </p>
